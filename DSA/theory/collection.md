### In Java, fail-fast and fail-safe describe how collections behave when they are modified during iteration:

Fail-Fast Collections:
* Behavior: Fail-fast collections immediately throw a ConcurrentModificationException if they detect that the collection has been modified (structurally) by another thread while iterating over it.
* Examples: ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet.
* Mechanism: These collections use an internal modification count (modCount) to detect concurrent modifications during iteration.

Fail-Safe Collections:
* Behavior: Fail-safe collections do not throw exceptions if modified during iteration because they operate on a clone or snapshot of the collection.
* Examples: CopyOnWriteArrayList, ConcurrentHashMap.
* Mechanism: They either work on a copy of the data or use more advanced techniques to allow safe iteration in a concurrent environment.
