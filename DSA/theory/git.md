# Merge and rebase are two different ways to integrate changes from one branch into another.

Merge preserves the history of both branches, creating a new commit that represents the merge.
This can result in a non-linear history, where the two branches are intertwined.

Rebase rewrites the history of the current branch, moving it to be on top of the target branch.
This results in a linear history, where the two branches are joined together.
