Q What is docker ?
> Docker is a powerful platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in lightweight, portable containers
* 1. Containerization
     * Docker allows applications to be packaged with all their dependencies and configuration, making them portable and isolated.
* 2. Portability Across Environments
     * Docker containers can run consistently across different environments: development, testing, and production
* 3. Version Control and Rollbacks
     * Docker images are versioned, allowing developers to track changes and roll back to previous versions if needed.
* 4. Rapid Deployment and Scalability
     * Containers make it easy to scale applications up or down quickly based on demand
