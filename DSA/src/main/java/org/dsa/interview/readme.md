# Algorithms frequently used to solve various problems:

### Brute Force:
The simplest approach that involves trying all possible solutions and selecting the best one. It is often used as a baseline for more optimized algorithms.
### Two Pointers:
Utilizes two pointers to traverse an array or string simultaneously, allowing efficient operations like finding subarrays or checking for patterns.
### Sliding Window:
Involves maintaining a window of elements while shifting or resizing the window based on certain conditions.
It is useful for solving problems involving subarrays or substrings.
### Binary Search: 
A divide-and-conquer algorithm used to efficiently find an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.
### Depth-First Search (DFS):
A recursive algorithm that explores all possible paths in a graph/tree until a certain condition is met.
It is often used for traversal and backtracking problems.
### Breadth-First Search (BFS): 
Explores a graph/tree level by level, visiting all the neighbors of a node before moving to the next level.
It is useful for finding the shortest path or exploring the nearest nodes.
### Dynamic Programming: 
A technique that breaks down complex problems into smaller overlapping subproblems and solves them to build up the solution.
It is used to optimize recursive or repetitive problems.
### Greedy Algorithm:
Makes locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.
It is often used for optimization problems, but may not always guarantee the best solution.
### Union-Find (Disjoint Set): 
A data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint subsets.
It is used to efficiently perform union and find operations and solve problems like connected components and cycle detection.
### Dijkstra's Algorithm: 
Finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.
It is widely used in route planning, network routing, and other optimization problems.

-> These are just a few examples of algorithms that are commonly used to solve various types of problems.
The choice of algorithm depends on the specific problem and its requirements
